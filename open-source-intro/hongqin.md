○ Brief description of the video

Her talk tells us what Open Source is like in the current era and the future. She introduced how the software had changed from the very beginning of the first software to the software we have been using today. She emphasized how Open Sources had brought us a better future by telling the changes in Africa. For instance, the number of African Open Source projects has increased by 40% in 2019; people in Macoco built their Open Source Project to consolidate safety for their neighborhood.

○ What did you learn from this?

I learned that Open Source Projects are creating huge impact to the world, even to the developing African countries. Sometimes, they are more than just a software, but a connected networks between each one of us that allows us to learn different cultures from people around the world. Also, they help to solve problems in real lives.
